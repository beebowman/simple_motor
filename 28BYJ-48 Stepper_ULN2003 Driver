//Wiring Instructions: https://lastminuteengineers.com/28byj48-stepper-motor-arduino-tutorial/
//Wiring: Attach IN1 to pin 8, IN2 to pin 9, IN3 to pin 10, IN4 to pin 11. Attach 5V of Nano to + of board, and GND of Nano to - of board. 
//Wiring for motion sensor: attach GND of sensor to GND of board, Power of sensor to 3.3V of board, and low/high output of sensor to A2 pin of the Nano board. 
//Board: Arduino Nano 


int inputPin = A2;                // choose the pin for the PIR motion sensor  (used to be 2!)
int pirState = LOW;             // we start, assuming no motion detected
int val = 0;                    // variable for reading the pin status

//Includes the Arduino Stepper Library
#include <Stepper.h>;

// Defines the number of steps per rotation
const int stepsPerRevolution = 2038;

// Creates an instance of stepper class
// Pins entered in sequence IN1-IN3-IN2-IN4 for proper step sequence
Stepper myStepper = Stepper(stepsPerRevolution, 8, 10, 9, 11);

void setup() {
    // Nothing to do for the motor (Stepper Library sets pins as outputs)

    //Code for the motion sensor: 
  pinMode(inputPin, INPUT);     // declare sensor as input
 
  Serial.begin(9600);

}

void loop() {

  if (digitalRead(inputPin) == HIGH) { //if the input of the sensor is HIGH (motion detected)
    	 //Rotate CW slowly at 5 RPM
    myStepper.setSpeed(5);
    myStepper.step(stepsPerRevolution);
    delay(8);


  }

  else  {

    delay(100);
    //Rotate CCW quickly at 10 RPM
    //myStepper.setSpeed(10);
    //myStepper.step(-stepsPerRevolution);
   // delay(100);
